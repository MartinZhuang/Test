00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:05,220
BRUNO DENUIT: 大家好
BRUNO DENUIT: Hi.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,226
我是Bruno
I'm Bruno.

4
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:08,870
我是EnPlug的首席软件架构师
I'm the Chief Software Architect at EnPlug.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,060
我们是第一家做数字标牌的开放软件平台
We are the first open software platform for digital signage.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,050
在这个视频里  我将要给你们展现
In this video, I would like to show you

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,820
你怎么才能使用EnPlug平台来开发一个应用
how you can use the EnPlug platform to develop an app

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,240
并且在世界上的任何一个物理设备上展现你的内容
and deploy your content to any physical device in the world.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,030
所以当我们开始做EnPlug的时候   
So when we started EnPlug, we decided

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,810
我们决定从Android平台开始着手  因为它是一个开放的平台
to go with the Android platform, because it's an open platform.

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,060
这是非常有名的  并且这让我们可以在非常便宜的设备
It's very popular, and it also let us run our software

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,810
上运行我们的软件
on inexpensive hardware.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,200
我们决定使我们的软件成为一个开放的平台
We decided to make our software an open platform

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,730
所以那些想展示自己页面在
so that the people who want to bring

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,290
数字世界的人可以通过
their content into the digital world

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,690
我们的平台专注于自身价值增长
could focus on their value add by building

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,500
并创建他们的应用
an app on our platform, and wouldn't

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,830
并且他们并不需要担心我们所担心的所有细节问题
have to worry about all the details that we had to worry about.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,190
所以你怎么才能开始做呢
So how do you start doing that?

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,880
你怎么才能开始在EnPlug的平台上写应用
How do you start writing an app for the EnPlug platform?

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,060
访问developers.enplug.com
Go to developers.enplug.com.

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,710
注册并且下载我们的SDK
Sign up and download our SDK.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,420
我们的SDK由两个部分组成
Our SDK is made up of two parts.

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,910
明显的是  这里有为写我们实际运行在设备上
Obviously, there is the SDK for actually writing the app

25
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,350
的应用所准备的SDK
that we run on the devices.

26
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,880
这个将为Android所使用  但是它也同样
It will run for Android, but it also

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,960
可以运行在桌面端  Mac和Windows以及我所提及的Chrome OS
runs in desktop, Mac and Windows, and now Chrome OS, like I mentioned.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,640
另外的部分就是如果你想让你的应用
And the other part is if you want your app

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,310
更好地可制定化  如果有一些配置
to be more customized, if there are certain configuration

30
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,370
是你想让你的用户进行选择的
settings that you want the user to select,

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,280
然后你可以使用我们的网页SDK来创建一个网页
then you can use our web SDK to create a web page,

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,540
并且让用户在EnPlug保存所有的配置以及各种事务
and have the user save all these configuration and things in EnPlug.

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,510
我们在Github上有两个样例应用
We have two examples on GitHub of sample apps

34
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,780
你们可以下载并且使用它们
that you can download and use out of the box.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,820
第一个样例是一个非常简单的应用
The first one is a very simple app

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,520
能够允许你展现任何样式的网页
that allows you to show any kind of web page.

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,690
所以你能够从头开始做
So you can get going from the start.

38
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,990
只需要下载那个应用  让它指向你的网站
Just download that app, point it to your websites,

39
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,620
然后它将展现在屏幕上
and it will start showing on the screen.

40
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,630
第二个应用是为那些
The second app is for people who want

41
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,390
有点基础并且想创建他们自己的应用的人准备的
to go a little bit further and create their own app,

42
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,110
他们想定制他们自己的应用
customize their own app.

43
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,210
并且那个包含了一个在我们平台上创建应用的一个框架
And that contains a framework for creating an app on our platform.

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,760
这里有一个我们网页应用的一个样例
So here you have an example of our web app

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,200
你可以配置你自己的独特的应用
where you can configure your different apps.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,520
你可以把他们打开或者关闭
You can toggle them on and off.

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,620
我选了Waitlist.me的应用来展示怎么来配置它
I selected Waitlist.me app to show how to configure it.

48
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,170
你可以去配置你的Waitlist应用
You can go and configure your Waitlist app.

49
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,660
它向你申请连接Waitlist.me的账户
It asks you to connect with an account on Waitlist.me.

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,390
所以这是一个EnPlug和第三方平台
So this is an example of the integration between EnPlug

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,290
集成的样例
and a third party.

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,915
输入你的Waitlist的证书
Type in your credentials for Waitlist.

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,710
你选择了你登陆的地点
You select the location that you are checked in with.

54
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:17,640
并且输入一些文本  一些标签
And type some text, some tagline.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,970
最少的聚会人数
Minimum number of people.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,540
这些是Waitlist.me的所有配置信息
These are all configuration settings for Waitlist.me.

57
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,870
你保存它  并且它展示
You save it, and it shows up preview of how

58
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,160
你的屏幕的样子的预览
your screen will look like.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,750
我希望你们体验一下EnPlug
I hope you check out EnPlug.

60
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,130
去developers.enplug.com
Go to developers.enplug.com.

61
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,910

62
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,400
